DB步骤
1 备份需要修改数据 得到的结果见 备份流水填错.CSV
SELECT * FROM `adm_lease_recharge_record`  WHERE `record_id`  IN 
(
	SELECT tb.rwId FROM 
	(

);

2 批量修改流水
UPDATE `adm_lease_recharge_record` a,
(
	SELECT * FROM 
	(
		select '20180102200040011100930089846593' as fwId,	 '08151488202426100034' as rwId union ALL

		select 'G4578900173357C' as fwId,	 '08151522872648700004' as rwId union ALL
		select 'G4578900173357C' as fwId,	 '08151522872631600000' as rwId union ALL
		select '20180110200040011100600094613368' as fwId,	 '08151556756060800050' as rwId union ALL

	)tb
)  b
SET  a.flow_id= b.fwId WHERE a.record_id = b.rwId;

3 标记出重复记录 在账户日志里表中有对应的扣款记录
update `adm_lease_recharge_record` set flow_id = CONCAT(flow_id,'重复') WHERE record_id IN
(

	'08151598431989900026',
	'08151609370402900061',
	'08151609511330200067',
	'08151609511421900068'
)
